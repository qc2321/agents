**Companies Not Selected:**

1. **FlutterFlow**
   - **Reason for Not Selecting:** Despite its strong market presence in no-code app development and potential growth in augmented reality applications, the scalability and immediate growth metrics are less compelling compared to Perplexity AI.

2. **Cohere**
   - **Reason for Not Selecting:** Although Cohere has a solid position and strategic alliances in the AI language model sector, its valuation and growth trajectory are currently overshadowed by Perplexity AI's more rapid expansion and market influence.

3. **Zebra Technologies**
   - **Reason for Not Selecting:** While Zebra Technologies is repositioning for potential recovery, its recent revenue declines and moderate investment potential make it a less attractive option against Perplexity AI's burgeoning growth.
